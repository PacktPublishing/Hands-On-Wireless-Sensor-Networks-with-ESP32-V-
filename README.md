# Hands-On Wireless Sensor Networks with ESP32 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Wireless Sensor Networks with ESP32 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/hands-wireless-sensor-networks-esp32-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The increase in the number of low-powered and portable smart devices has fostered the Internet of things. Maintaining, controlling, and monitoring network of such devices is quite challenging. It becomes difficult for individual sensor nodes to have knowledge of the whole network. 
This course starts off with the fundamentals of Wireless Sensors Networks. You will see how to overcome challenges in gathering and propagating data to an entire network whose size and density is unknown; learn to use protocols and algorithms, allowing each sensor node to sense the aggregated physical environmental conditions of the entire network; and apply graph theory to a sensor's network to model a smarter environment. With hands-on sessions, you'll develop P2P using the open source ESP32 microchip. 
By the end of the course, you will have gained a deep understanding of managing, controlling, and maintaining a fully distributed, wireless sensor network using the ESP32 system on a chip.
